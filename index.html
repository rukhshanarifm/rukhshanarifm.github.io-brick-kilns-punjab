<h1>Brick Kilns in Punjab, Pakistan</h1>

        <h2>Context:</h2>
      <p>
          Approximately 20,000 brick kilns are the 
          primary source of brick production in 
          Pakistan across the country's 4 provinces. 
          Punjab is the largest in terms of population 
          of these provinces. In 2018,
          the Punjab governmentâ€™s Urban Unit
          conducted a province-wide survey of ~6800 kilns.
          Information on kilns and kiln-employees was collected
          and published publicly.          
        </p>
        <h2>Process: </h2>
        <p>
            To make bricks, soil is mixed with water and kneaded
            into a dough which is then placed into brick-shaped
            moulds. After being dried in the open, they are baked
            in kilns where temperatures reach 1100C. (Source: Al
            Jazeera).

        <h2>Concerns:</h2>
        <p>
            Kilns are a source of air pollution and deplorable
            working conditions. Skin diseases, asthma and risk of
            tuberculosis are common amongst workers. Furthermore,
            employees face debt as they are forced into taking
            high-interest loans from kiln owners (to
            sustain their families). Lack of accountability and
            corruption result in employees being trapped by debt.
            Kiln employees also have a lack of access to medical
            facilities. Cases of child-labor are prevalent and significantly underreported.
        </p>
        <h2>Aim:</h2>
        <p>
            Our aim is to provide context to the
            viwer about how brick kilns are distributed across
            Punjab in addition to how kiln demographics may vary
            by districts within the province. We look at district-wise 
            averages for age, daily wage, loan amounts and distances to educational/health facilities.
            Furthermore, we look at the percentages of children who earn a non-zero wage in addition to looking at the
            percentage of children who responded to the survey by each tehsil within a district. Tehsils can be thought of to be subdivisions of districts.
